**INTRODUCTION**
COVID-19 (Corona virus disease 2019) is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. It was 
identified in December 2019 in China. It was declared a pandemic by WHO. COVID-19â€™s 
doubling rate is on average 7.4 days. The spread of COVID-19 is due to the transmission of 
corona virus. Corona virus enters the human body through openings like the mouth, nose, and 
eyes. The droplets exerted through sneezing, coughing, and sometimes talking can spread the 
corona viruses from person to person.

The proposed methodology in this project is used to maintain a social distance of 1.5 m in the 
vicinity. Various approaches were suggested by the researchers. We used the CCTV cameras 
data either at a public place or through the surveillance system through the Drone to check the 
crowd status in public places. Based on the crowd, governing authorities decide for maintaining 
the social distancing and preventive measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19. But these 
approaches are applicable in a mass population. At the same time, it is a responsibility of an 
individual to follow the interim guidelines issued by the WHO to maintain social distancing of 
2 m. For the same, there is no such technical mechanism. Due to this, there is a need for such a 
device that will find the presence of human beings in the vicinity and alerts individually about 
the same so that he/she will maintain a social distancing.
Based on this approach, in the proposed work the wearable device is suggested. This device will 
help each individual to maintain at least social distancing. Due to this, the spread of the COVID-19 virus will minimize. In the suggested proposed device, Ultrasonic Distance sensor interfaced 
with Arduino which will detect the human presence. If human presence will be there, then it will 
notify the individual through the audio message. Hence, the individual will be alerted and will 
maintain the social distancing at the public place also. By wearing this device, any person will 
come to know the presence of a human being nearby him/her. Due to that, it will be helpful to 
keep social distancing to avoid the spread of the COVID-19 viru
